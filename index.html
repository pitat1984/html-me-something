                        <h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
                        <p>By far, one of the most beautiful places I've backpacked.  Having backpacked differents parts of the park twice, I still find it breathtaking.  The views are surreal.  It was tough to get to the top of Half Dome.  The cable walkway was a little uneasy (a woman had to be helicoptered off the top) but well worth it.</p>

                        <h2>Ireland</h2>
                        <p>For our mother's 60th birthday, my brother and I bought our mother a trip to Ireland with the two of us.  One of her dreams has always been to take us there.  Well if we waited for her to get around to doing it, we may never make it.  We flew into Dublin and did an excursion clockwise around the country, staying in Waterford, Kinsale, Dingle, Galway, and other smaller towns along the way.</p>

                            <h2>China</h2>
                            <p>My youngest brother Sean took an opprtunity in China a few years ago to work as a tutor teching english to Chinese folks.  He ended up sticking around for a little while, met a wonderful woman Ivy, and got engaged.  The wedding being in China offered a good opportunity to see the country.  It was another great experience.  My wife, Ellen, our daugheter, Tierney, and I made the trip with the rest of our family.  We saw the Forbidden City in Beijing and ate duck feet.  We say the Terracotta Warriors in Xian and rode a tandem bike on the top of the city walls.  And we saw amazing imperial gardens in Suzhou...</p>
